            <h1>💌 A Sweet Confession 💌</h1>
            <div class="letter">
                <p>Hi,</p>
                <p>This is the first time I’ve ever had the courage to confess like this, so I really hope you take a moment to read my letter.</p>
                <p>Honestly, I don’t think words will ever be enough to fully express what I feel, but I want you to know this—I've liked you for a very long time. Almost a decade. Yes, almost a decade. And I think that’s reason enough for me to finally be honest, you might be wondering why it took me this long, or how someone could feel the same way for so many years. To be honest, even I still wonder about that sometimes… and I just end up laughing to myself.</p>
                <p>We became classmates back in Grade 3. We started as friends—teasing each other, running around, chasing one another after school. Looking back, those moments feel so simple yet so meaningful. I’m really grateful that I got to know you and became your classmate, because if I hadn’t, maybe I wouldn’t have known someone like you at all. Little by little, we grew closer, and without me even realizing it, my feelings slowly changed. What I thought was just a happy crush turned into something deeper. As time passed, my feelings didn’t fade—they grew. And I never expected them to last this long.</p>
                <p>You know that feeling when no matter how many people come into your life, there’s still that one person your heart quietly goes back to? That’s how it’s always been for me. Through different phases of my life, through different people, somehow, it was always you.</p>
                <p>I want to be clear about something—I’m not telling you all of this to pressure you or to make you feel obligated to feel the same way. That’s never been my intention. I believe that emotions are deeply personal and not something we can force or control. It’s completely okay if you don’t share the same feelings I have. My only reason for writing this is to be honest, because I value you and the connection we have.</p>
                <p>I never regretted loving you for this long. Not even once. You are a good son, a caring and loving brother, respectful to the people around you, someone with dreams and purpose, and most of all, a man of God. You embody the qualities I’ve always admired and hoped for in a man. And maybe that’s why my feelings stayed—because you were never just someone I liked, you were someone I truly respected.</p>
                <p>Regardless of how you may feel after reading this, I want you to know how thankful I am for the moments we shared, even the ones that seemed ordinary at the time. For the conversations, the laughter, and even the silence—you brought joy into my life in ways you probably never realized. And I will always be grateful for that.</p>
                <p>Reaching this point where I finally chose to confess, I’m not asking for anything in return. I don’t expect you to immediately reciprocate my feelings or to force yourself to feel something you don’t. I just wanted to be true—to myself and to you. Whether these feelings remain quietly here or end with this letter, I will accept everything with an open heart.</p>
                <p>Thank you for simply being you. Thank you for the small moments and memories that you may not have intentionally left behind, but that stayed with me and became a part of who I am. If the day ever comes when things change, all I wish for is that there will always be respect, understanding, and comfort between us.</p>
                <p>And if you never figure out that this letter came from me, that’s okay too. It’s enough for me to know that at least once in my life, I loved someone fully, sincerely, and without any regrets.</p>
